All notable changes to this crate are documented in this file.

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this crate adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned (v0.4.0 — Tier 2 gap closures)

See [`docs/SEVEN-SKETCHES-AUDIT.md`](docs/SEVEN-SKETCHES-AUDIT.md) "Tier 2" for scope.

- `Prop` type + `Free(G)` construction (Def 5.2, 5.25)
- `OperadAlgebra<O>` (Def 6.99)
- `OperadFunctor` (Rough Def 6.98)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-18

Tier 1.1 follow-ups flagged during v0.3.0 work.

### Added

- `DecoratedCospan::compose` now invokes `D::pushforward` through the pushout quotient (realizes F&S Def 6.75 / Thm 6.77 for decorations whose apex data references apex indices).
- Direct `PetriNet::permute_side` implementation via in-place permutation of the transition sequence — replaces the decoration-bridge impl that discarded boundary permutations on the return trip.
- `Transition::relabel` arc deduplication: when the quotient collapses distinct places onto the same target, arcs merge with summed `Decimal` multiplicities. Pre- and post-arcs dedup independently (self-loops preserved). Canonical ascending-by-place sort.
- `examples/petri_net_braiding.rs` — direct `permute_side` demo.
- `tests/decorated_cospan.rs` — 3 integration tests covering Circuit EdgeSet series composition, `Trivial` pushforward unit, `PetriDecoration` regression safety.
- `tests/petri_net.rs` — 8 new tests (4 braiding + 4 arc-dedup).

### Changed

- `examples/decorated_cospan_circuit.rs` extended with series composition; `NOTE:` caveat block removed.
- `SEVEN-SKETCHES-AUDIT.md` Ex 6.79–6.86 row upgraded from PARTIAL to DONE; headline recomputed (9 DONE / 3 PARTIAL / 12 MISSING / 17 N/A / 15 IN CORE of 56 items).

### Requires

- catgraph v0.11.3 for `Cospan::compose_with_quotient`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-17

Tier 1 gap closures (from v0.2.0 audit).

### Added

- Generic `DecoratedCospan<Lambda, D>` + `Decoration` trait — realizes F&S Def 6.75 (decorated cospans) and Thm 6.77 (decorated cospan category is a hypergraph category).
- `PetriDecoration<Lambda>` marker type bridging `PetriNet` to the generic `DecoratedCospan` machinery.
- `HypergraphCategory<Lambda>` impl for both `DecoratedCospan<Lambda, D>` (generic) and `PetriNet<Lambda>` (specialized).
- `examples/decorated_cospan_circuit.rs` — Circuit EdgeSet example.
- `Trivial` decoration as an uninformative starting example.

### Known limitations (closed in 0.3.1)

- `DecoratedCospan::compose` did not yet invoke `D::pushforward` (required upstream `Cospan::compose_with_quotient`).
- `PetriNet::permute_side` delegated to the decoration bridge, which discarded leg permutations.
- `Transition::relabel` produced duplicate `(place, weight)` entries when the quotient collapsed places.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- `docs/SEVEN-SKETCHES-AUDIT.md` — section-by-section coverage audit against Fong & Spivak, *Seven Sketches in Compositionality* (arXiv:1803.05316v3, 2018). 56 items tracked across Chapters 4–6.
- Cross-reconciliation with `catgraph/docs/FONG-SPIVAK-AUDIT.md`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- Initial release. Applied-CT modules extracted from `catgraph` core as part of the v0.11.0 slim-baseline refactor:
  - `linear_combination.rs` — formal linear combinations over a coefficient ring (R-module `R[T]`).
  - `wiring_diagram.rs` — operadic substitution on named cospans (F&S §6.5 Ex 6.94 Cospan operad).
  - `petri_net.rs` — place/transition nets, firing, reachability, parallel/sequential composition, cospan bridge.
  - `temperley_lieb.rs` — Temperley-Lieb / Brauer algebra via perfect matchings, Jones relations, dagger.
  - `e1_operad.rs` — little-intervals operad (E₁).
  - `e2_operad.rs` — little-disks operad (E₂).
- Criterion bench `rayon_thresholds`.
