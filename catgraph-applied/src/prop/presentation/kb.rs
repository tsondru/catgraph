//! Bounded congruence-closure decision procedure for [`super::Presentation`]-modulo equality.
//!
//! Given a term graph over [`PropExpr<G>`] and a seed set of equations,
//! computes the smallest congruence relation containing the seed, then
//! answers `are_equal` queries by union-find root comparison.
//!
//! Based on the Downey-Sethi-Tarjan 1980 algorithm using a signature-table
//! indexed by canonical child-class IDs. Correct for finitely-presented
//! equational theories without binders; complete for the 16 F&S Thm 5.60
//! equations (Baez-Erbele 2015).
//!
//! This engine is **not** full Knuth-Bendix completion with critical-pair
//! discovery — it seeds a term graph with the user's equations as-is, then
//! propagates congruence through `Compose` / `Tensor`. For a confluent,
//! terminating rewrite system, this is a decision procedure. For the 16
//! Thm 5.60 equations specifically, Baez-Erbele 2015 proved completeness, so
//! congruence closure with this seed decides Mat(R)-equality on SFG
//! expressions.
//!
//! # Algorithm sketch
//!
//! The term graph hash-conses every sub-term to a `TermId`. A signature
//! table keyed on `(Tag, root_class(arg_a), root_class(arg_b))` records the
//! canonical representative of each function-node congruence class. On
//! `add_term` we probe this table: if a match exists, the new term is
//! immediately merged into the existing class. On `merge` we walk the uses
//! lists of the smaller class, re-probing each function node's signature
//! against the (now updated) table — any collision produces another merge,
//! propagating congruence to fixpoint.
//!
//! # Complexity
//!
//! Per `are_equal` query:
//! - Term insertion: `O(|a| + |b|)` expected, assuming `O(1)` hash
//!   operations on the term / signature tables.
//! - Congruence propagation: amortized `O(n · α(n))` total across all
//!   merges, where `α` is the inverse-Ackermann function (from union-find
//!   with path halving).
//!
//! With a sorted-pair signature representation (as in the original DST
//! paper) the `α(n)` bound extends to per-insertion; we trade that for
//! the average-case simplicity of a hash table.
