# Seven Sketches Coverage Audit (catgraph-applied v0.5.1)

> **Paper:** Fong & Spivak, *Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory* (arXiv:1803.05316v3, 12 Oct 2018)
> **Library:** catgraph-applied v0.5.1 (workspace member of catgraph v0.12.0)
> **Date:** 2026-04-16 (Phase 5 initial audit); updated 2026-04-20 for v0.4.0 Tier 2; updated 2026-04-21 for v0.5.0 Tier 3; updated 2026-04-22 for v0.5.1 enrichment + CC engine
> **Method:** read all 334 pages of the textbook, cross-checked each numbered definition/theorem/example against catgraph-applied source and catgraph core
>
> **Note on scope:** *Seven Sketches* is a 334-page textbook covering seven topics in applied CT. Only **Chapters 4, 5, and 6** contain formal content relevant to catgraph-applied's modules. Chapters 1–3 (orders, enrichment, databases) and Chapter 7 (toposes) establish foundational CT that catgraph core already provides or that is outside catgraph's scope entirely.
>
> **Relationship to catgraph core audit:** The core catgraph crate tracks Fong & Spivak's *Hypergraph Categories* (arXiv:1806.08304v3, 2019) — the research paper that formalizes the §6.3 content into a full equivalence theorem. See [`catgraph/docs/FONG-SPIVAK-AUDIT.md`](../../catgraph/docs/FONG-SPIVAK-AUDIT.md) for the core audit. This audit covers the *textbook* content that goes beyond that paper: decorated cospans, operads and their algebras, props, signal flow, and wiring diagrams for monoidal/compact-closed/hypergraph categories.

**Status legend:**
- ✅ DONE — implemented and tested
- ⚠️ PARTIAL — implementation exists but is incomplete or doesn't fully exhibit the paper's structure
- ❌ MISSING — not implemented in catgraph-applied (or catgraph core)
- ➖ N/A — theoretical / motivational / pedagogical, no implementation expected
- 🔗 IN CORE — implemented in catgraph core (not catgraph-applied); noted for completeness

| Def 5.13: (m,n)-port graph | ⚠️ | catgraph-applied::petri_net | `PetriNet` is a bipartite graph with typed ports; not literally a port graph but structurally adjacent. `WiringDiagram` inner/outer circles are closer. |
| Def 5.25: free prop on a signature Free(G) | ✅ | catgraph-applied::prop::Free | `Free<G>::{identity, braid, generator, compose, tensor}` smart constructors on `PropExpr<G>`, arity-checked at construction time.

| Def 5.30: G-generated prop expressions | ✅ | catgraph-applied::prop::PropExpr + prop::presentation | `PropExpr<G>` realises the syntactic layer (Identity/Braid/Generator/Compose/Tensor); `Presentation::normalize` applies the 8-rule SMC canonical form (interchange, unitors, braiding naturality). Shipped in catgraph-applied v0.5.0. Note: the quotient uses bounded structural rewriting; Knuth-Bendix completion is v0.5.1 work. |
| Rough Def 5.33: presentation (G, s, t, E) for a prop | ✅ | catgraph-applied::prop::presentation::Presentation | `Presentation<G>` with `add_equation`, `normalize`, `eq_mod`, `with_depth`. 8-rule SMC canonical form applied first; user-supplied equations then applied left-to-right. Shipped in catgraph-applied v0.5.0. |
| Remark 5.34: universal property of presentations | ➖ | — | theoretical |
| Prop 5.29: universal property of Free(G) | ➖ | — | theoretical |

### §5.3 Simplified signal flow graphs (pp. 159–168)

| Item | Status | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Def 5.36: rig (semiring) | ✅ | catgraph-applied::rig | `Rig` trait (blanket impl over `num_traits::{Zero,One}` + Add + Mul) + 4 concrete instances: `BoolRig` (∨,∧), `UnitInterval` ([0,1] Viterbi), `Tropical` ([0,∞], min, +), `F64Rig`. `verify_rig_axioms` + `BaseChange<UnitInterval>` for `Tropical`. Shipped in catgraph-applied v0.5.0. |

Functoriality (S(f∘g) = S(f)·S(g), S(f⊗g) = S(f)⊕S(g)) verified on all 4 rigs via 13 integration tests. Shipped in catgraph-applied v0.5.0. |
| Prop 5.54: matrix S(g) describes input→output amplification | ✅ | catgraph-applied::sfg_to_mat (implicit) | Implicitly verified by Thm 5.53 functoriality tests; the generator matrices are exact per Eq 5.52. No standalone test. |

### §5.4 Graphical linear algebra (pp. 168–178)

| Item | Status | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Thm 5.60: presentation of Mat(R) from Frobenius + rig equations | ⚠️ | catgraph-applied::graphical_linalg | `matr_presentation<R>` builds all 16 equations from F&S p.170 (Groups A cocomonoid, B monoid, C bialgebra, D scalar — D1/D3/D4/D5/D6 instantiated for `rig_samples`). **PARTIAL — carried forward to v0.5.2.** v0.5.1 added the CC engine (`prop::presentation::kb::CongruenceClosure`) and routed the faithfulness harness through `eq_mod`, closing the overlapping-user-equation branch of the problem. The 12 `thm_5_60_faithful_*` tests remain `#[ignore]`'d pending SMC string-diagram normal form in `apply_smc_rules` — the one-pass bottom-up rewriter can't canonicalize interchange-requires-reassociation cases (e.g., `ε ⊗ (σ ⊗ id)` vs `(ε ⊗ id₃); (σ ⊗ id)`). Deferred to v0.5.2. |
| Def 5.65: monoid object in SMC (commutative monoid axioms) | ❌ | — | catgraph has `FrobeniusOperation` (monoid + comonoid) but no standalone `MonoidObject` in general SMC; deferred to v0.6.0+ |
| Thm 5.87: hypergraph category from linear relations | ➖ | — | LinRel deferred (same as core audit) |

### §6.2 Colimits and connection (pp. 184–196)

| Item | Status | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Def 6.1: initial object | ➖ | — | pedagogical; catgraph uses ∅ as monoidal unit |
| Def 6.11: coproduct | ➖ | — | pedagogical; catgraph monoidal product is coproduct on FinSet |
| Def 6.19: pushout | 🔗 | catgraph::cospan | union-find pushout composition |
| Prop 6.32: finite colimits ⟺ initial + pushouts | 🔗 | catgraph core (implicit) | FinSet has both |
| Thm 6.37: colimit formula as equivalence classes | 🔗 | catgraph::cospan | pushout via union-find is exactly this formula |
| Def 6.43 + 6.45: cospan, Cospan_C category | 🔗 | catgraph::cospan | `Cospan<Lambda>` with pushout composition |

### §6.3 Hypergraph categories (pp. 197–203)

| Thm 6.55: spider theorem (connected diagrams = spiders) | 🔗 ✅ | catgraph::frobenius + `tests/spider_theorem.rs` | Explicit tests shipped in catgraph v0.11.2 — 5 tests covering s_{2,2}, s_{3,1}, s_{1,3}, s_{0,0} and connected-diagram shape via `special_frobenius_morphism` constructor |
| Thm 6.58: free prop on Frobenius ≅ Cospan_FinSet | 🔗 | catgraph::cospan_algebra + hypergraph_functor | `CospanToFrobeniusFunctor` (Prop 3.8 in the research paper) |
| Def 6.60: hypergraph category | 🔗 | catgraph::hypergraph_category | `HypergraphCategory` trait |
| Ex 6.61: Cospan_C is a hypergraph category | 🔗 | catgraph::hypergraph_category | `impl HypergraphCategory for Cospan<Lambda>` |
| Ex 6.64: Corel is a hypergraph category | ✅ | catgraph::corel | `Corel<Lambda>` type with full `HypergraphCategory<Lambda>` impl shipped in **catgraph v0.12.0**. See [catgraph/CHANGELOG.md](../../catgraph/CHANGELOG.md) for the coarsen-and-compose semantics. |
| Prop 6.66: hypergraph cats are self-dual compact closed | 🔗 | catgraph::compact_closed | cup/cap from η;δ and μ;ε |
| Temperley-Lieb as diagrammatic SMC (spider-theorem adjacent) | ✅ | catgraph-applied::temperley_lieb | `BrauerMorphism` composition via connected components + loop counting; TL generators e_i; Frobenius-law-adjacent relations tested (e_i² = δ·e_i, Jones relations) |

### §6.4 Decorated cospans (pp. 203–211)

| Item | Status | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rough Def 6.68: symmetric monoidal functor (F, φ) | ➖ | — | theoretical; catgraph uses `HypergraphFunctor` |
| Def 6.75: F-decorated cospan | ✅ | catgraph-applied::decorated_cospan | `Decoration` trait + generic `DecoratedCospan<Lambda, D>` struct. `PetriDecoration` specializes to Petri nets; `Circuit` example specializes to EdgeSet on apex vertices. Shipped in catgraph-applied v0.3.0. |
| Thm 6.77: Cospan_F is a hypergraph category | ✅ | catgraph-applied::decorated_cospan + petri_net | `impl HypergraphCategory<Lambda> for DecoratedCospan<Lambda, D>` realizes the theorem generically (any `D: Decoration`). `impl HypergraphCategory<Lambda> for PetriNet<Lambda>` specializes via `from_cospan`. v0.3.0. |
| Ex 6.79–6.86: Circ functor, decorated cospan composition for circuits | ✅ | catgraph-applied::decorated_cospan + examples/decorated_cospan_circuit.rs | Parallel and series composition both demonstrated in v0.3.1; series composition uses `Cospan::compose_with_quotient` + `D::pushforward` to coequalize the shared boundary vertex. |
| Ex 6.88: closed circuits via η;x;ε composition | ❌ | — | no closed-circuit construction |
| Petri net cospan bridge (pre/post arc weights as left/right legs) | ✅ | catgraph-applied::petri_net | `from_cospan`, `transition_as_cospan` — multiplicity-weighted cospan bridge. `fire`, `enabled`, `reachable` for state-space exploration. |

### §6.5 Operads and their algebras (pp. 211–218)

| Item | Status | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rough Def 6.91: operad (types, operations, substitution ∘_i, identities) | ✅ | catgraph::operadic + catgraph-applied::e1_operad, e2_operad | `Operadic` trait in core defines substitution with identity/associativity laws. E₁ and E₂ implement concrete operads with validated substitution. |

| Ex 6.94: Cospan operad (cospans as operations, substitution by pushout) | ✅ | catgraph-applied::wiring_diagram | `WiringDiagram` implements `Operadic` with cospan-pushout substitution. This IS the Cospan operad specialized to named cospans with inner/outer circles. |
| Eq 6.95: wiring diagram as cospan operation | ✅ | catgraph-applied::wiring_diagram | the `Operadic::substitute` implementation literally performs this: replace an inner circle with a sub-diagram, connecting ports by name |
| Def 6.97: operad O_C underlying any SMC C | ⚠️ | catgraph::operadic (trait) | the `Operadic` trait captures the abstract interface, but there is no generic construction that takes an arbitrary SMC and produces its underlying operad |
| Rough Def 6.98: operad functor | ✅ | catgraph-applied::operad_functor | `OperadFunctor<O1, O2, Input>` trait plus concrete `E1ToE2` packaging the canonical little-intervals-into-little-disks inclusion. Literal geometric functoriality is verified by `E1ToE2::check_substitution_preserved` (comparing disks by centre/radius within f32 tolerance, modulo naming); a generic arity-level shadow helper covers any functor. Shipped in catgraph-applied v0.4.0. |
| Def 6.99: operad algebra (F: O → Set) | ✅ | catgraph-applied::operad_algebra | Single-sorted `OperadAlgebra<O, Input>` trait generic over any `Operadic<Input>` operad; concrete `CircAlgebra` implementing F&S Ex 6.100 for `WiringDiagram` (carrier = outer-port count, verifying Ex 6.100's invariance under substitution). Shipped in catgraph-applied v0.4.0. |
| Prop 6.101: Cospan-algebras ≅ hypergraph props | ⚠️ | catgraph::cospan_algebra + equivalence + catgraph-applied::operad_algebra | the per-Λ version (Thm 4.13 in the research paper) is verified in catgraph core. With v0.4.0, the operadic side of the equivalence (Cospan-*algebras* in the operad sense) is now expressible as `OperadAlgebra<WiringDiagram, _>` instances; the `≅` itself remains a test-only consolidation task. |

## Critical findings

### What catgraph-applied implements well

1. **Operadic substitution (§6.5)** — `WiringDiagram` faithfully implements the Cospan operad (Ex 6.94) with name-matched port substitution. This is the textbook's primary concrete operad example. E₁ and E₂ operads demonstrate the abstract definition (Rough Def 6.91) with geometric substitution (affine rescaling).

2. **Temperley-Lieb / Brauer algebra (§6.3 adjacent)** — `BrauerMorphism` implements the diagrammatic category of perfect matchings with composition via connected components and closed-loop counting. TL generators and Jones relations are tested. This goes beyond the textbook (which mentions Frobenius diagrams and spiders but not TL specifically) into representation-theoretic territory.

3. **Petri net cospan bridge (§6.4 specialized)** — `PetriNet` implements a specific decorated cospan with multiplicity-weighted arc structure, BFS reachability, and parallel/sequential composition. The cospan bridge (`from_cospan` / `transition_as_cospan`) is well-tested.

4. **Linear combinations (§5.3 infrastructure)** — `LinearCombination<Coeffs, Target>` provides the free R-module over a basis set, with convolution product, functorial pushforward, and scalar operations. This is the algebraic infrastructure that the textbook presupposes (rigs, rings) but doesn't package as a standalone construct.

### Major gaps

1. ~~**Props and presentations (§5.2)**~~ — ✅ **CLOSED in catgraph-applied v0.4.0–v0.5.0.** `Prop` type and `Free(G)` in `catgraph-applied::prop` (v0.4.0); `Presentation<G>` with 8-rule SMC canonical form (v0.5.0, `prop::presentation`). Def 5.30 and Def 5.33 both DONE.

2. ~~**Signal flow graphs and Mat(R) (§5.3–5.4)**~~ — ✅ **CLOSED in catgraph-applied v0.5.0.** `SignalFlowGraph<R>` (Def 5.45), `MatR<R>` (Def 5.50), and `sfg_to_mat` functor (Thm 5.53) all shipped. catgraph can now demonstrate the textbook's main Ch 5 result. Thm 5.60 remains PARTIAL — v0.5.1 added the CC engine as the default `eq_mod` backend (closing the overlapping-user-equation branch of the problem) but the 12 faithfulness enumeration tests still require SMC string-diagram normal form in `apply_smc_rules` (deferred to v0.5.2).

3. ~~**General decorated cospans (§6.4)**~~ — ✅ **CLOSED in catgraph-applied v0.3.0/v0.3.1.** `Decoration` trait + `DecoratedCospan<Lambda, D>` in `catgraph-applied::decorated_cospan`. `PetriDecoration` specializes to Petri nets; `Circuit` EdgeSet example specializes to resistor circuits. `HypergraphCategory<Lambda>` realized generically (Thm 6.77). `D::pushforward` wired through `Composable::compose` via `Cospan::compose_with_quotient` in v0.3.1; direct `PetriNet::permute_side` added.

4. ~~**Operad algebras (§6.5 Def 6.99)**~~ — ✅ **CLOSED in catgraph-applied v0.4.0.** Single-sorted `OperadAlgebra<O, Input>` trait in `catgraph-applied::operad_algebra`; `CircAlgebra` implementing F&S Ex 6.100 for `WiringDiagram`. Prop 6.101 (Cospan-algebras ≅ hypergraph props) — the operadic side of the equivalence is now expressible; a test-only consolidation of the `≅` remains.

5. ~~**Operad functors (§6.5 Rough Def 6.98)**~~ — ✅ **CLOSED in catgraph-applied v0.4.0.** `OperadFunctor<O1, O2, Input>` trait with concrete `E1ToE2` packaging the canonical little-intervals-into-little-disks inclusion; literal geometric functoriality verified by comparing E₂ disk positions modulo naming.

6. ~~**Corel as hypergraph category (§6.3 Ex 6.64)**~~ — ✅ **CLOSED in catgraph v0.12.0.** `Corel<Lambda>` with `HypergraphCategory<Lambda>` impl shipped in catgraph core.

### Items intentionally deferred

- **Ch 1–3** (orders, enrichment, databases): foundational CT already in catgraph core or out of scope
- **Ch 7** (toposes, sheaves, logic): out of scope for catgraph
- **LinRel examples** (Ex 6.65, Thm 5.87): deferred per core audit decision
- **Profunctor categories** (Thm 4.63): enriched profunctors are out of catgraph's scope

### Items that are implicit / "morally present" but not explicit

1. **Thm 6.55 (spider theorem)** — ✅ **CLOSED in catgraph v0.11.2.** `tests/spider_theorem.rs` asserts shape equality between connected Frobenius diagrams and the canonical spiders produced by `special_frobenius_morphism(m, n, z)`.

2. **Def 6.97 (operad underlying an SMC)** — the `Operadic` trait captures the interface but the generic *construction* that derives an operad from any SMC is not automated.

3. **Prop 6.101 (Cospan-algebras ≅ hypergraph props)** — the per-Λ equivalence (Thm 4.13 in the research paper) is verified in catgraph core. Restating it in operadic language would be a test-only task.

## Inheritance from catgraph core

catgraph-applied builds on catgraph's F&S 2019 primitives. The following textbook items are **already implemented in catgraph core** and available to catgraph-applied modules:

| Textbook item | catgraph core location | catgraph-applied usage |
|---|---|---|
| Def 6.19: pushout composition | `cospan.rs` (union-find) | `WiringDiagram::substitute`, `PetriNet::from_cospan` |
| Def 6.43 + 6.45: Cospan_C | `cospan.rs`, `named_cospan.rs` | `WiringDiagram` wraps `NamedCospan` |
| Def 6.52: Frobenius structure | `frobenius/operations.rs` | `BrauerMorphism` TL generators; `WiringDiagram` operadic structure |
| Def 6.60: hypergraph category | `hypergraph_category.rs` | ✅ `impl HypergraphCategory<Lambda> for PetriNet<Lambda>` shipped in v0.3.0; generic `impl` for `DecoratedCospan<Lambda, D>` shipped alongside |
| Prop 6.66: self-dual compact closed | `compact_closed.rs` | `BrauerMorphism::dagger` uses compact closed structure |
| Thm 6.58: Cospan ≅ free Frobenius | `cospan_algebra.rs` | foundation for operadic substitution |
| Rough Def 4.45: SMC | `monoidal.rs` | `WiringDiagram`, `BrauerMorphism` implement `Monoidal` |

No duplication of F&S primitives in catgraph-applied — it depends on catgraph.

Investigation during v0.5.1 revealed that `apply_smc_rules` (one-pass bottom-up rewriter) cannot canonicalize interchange-requires-reassociation cases. Closing the gap requires Joyal-Street string-diagram normal form, not further user-equation rewriting. |

The *Operadic* trait is anchored to [FS18] §6.5; the wiring diagram interpretation is anchored to [FS18] §6.3.2 + §4.4.2. [FS19] only references wiring diagrams illustratively in §2.5. |

## Enrichment extension point: grammar, language, and magnitude

catgraph-applied stays in the `Set`-enriched (ordinary) categorical world: all hom-sets are plain Rust collections. The *enriched* refinement — where hom-objects live in a monoidal base `V` (e.g. `[0,1]`, `[0,∞]`, a tropical semiring, or a more general semiring) — is deliberately pushed one level up into a future sibling crate `catgraph-magnitude` (Phase 6). This section records the paper provenance and the cross-link so future readers can trace the design decision.

### Paper provenance for the enriched layer

- **[BTV21]** Bradley, Terilla, Vlassopoulos, *An enriched category theory of language: from syntax to semantics* (arXiv:2106.07890v2, 2021).
  Defines the syntax category `L` — objects = strings of tokens, hom-objects `L(x, y) = π(y|x) ∈ [0,1]` (extension probability), enrichment over `([0,1], ≥, ·, 1)`. The semantic category `L̂` is the enriched copresheaf category; Yoneda identifies each text with its representable `L(x, −)`. [FS18] §1.1 (enriched categories over a poset) + §2.4 (V-categories) are the relevant pedagogical anchors; [FS18] does not cover language or LLM applications.

- **[BV25]** Bradley, Vigneaux, *The magnitude of categories of texts enriched by language models* (arXiv:2501.06662v2, 2025).
  For an autoregressive LM with BOS `⊥`, EOS `†`, and cutoff, defines a `[0,1]`-enriched category `M`. Computes the magnitude function via the Leinster-Shulman Möbius construction:

  ```
  Mag(tM) = (t − 1) · Σ_{x ∈ ob(M) \ T(⊥)} H_t(p_x)  +  #(T(⊥)),   t > 0
  ```

  where `H_t` is the `t`-logarithmic (Tsallis) entropy and `T(⊥)` is the set of terminating strings. Recovers a sum of Shannon entropies at `d/dt Mag|_{t=1}`. Expresses magnitude as the Euler characteristic of magnitude homology; gives `MH_0` and `MH_1` explicitly.

### Why the enriched layer is not in catgraph-applied v0.1.0

1. **Scope discipline.** catgraph-applied v0.1.0 covers [FS18] Ch 4–6 in the unenriched setting. Enrichment adds a parallel axis (the base `V`) that belongs in a dedicated crate rather than leaking into every existing type signature.
2. **Semiring machinery is substantial.** `Semiring`, `WeightedCospan<Q>`, magnitude, Möbius, Tsallis entropy, `[0,∞]`-metric-space view, tropical semiring — enough surface area for a standalone crate.
3. **Magnitude is physics-application-grade.** BV25's closed-form magnitude formula is the first application that promotes "enriched cospans" from a nice abstraction to a concrete numerical invariant with a correctness anchor. It deserves its own release cadence and example suite.
4. **Agent-coalition application is pending downstream framework evaluation.** The Phase 6 design needs to settle on an agent-framework substrate before locking the `Semiring + WeightedCospan` API. Doing this inside catgraph-applied would couple the applied-CT audit to an unsettled downstream design.

### Grammar without external grammar input

A central claim of [BTV21] is that **grammatical and semantic content arise from the enriched structure alone** — no externally-supplied grammar is needed. This contrasts with DisCoCat (Coecke-Sadrzadeh-Clark), which takes a pregroup grammar as input.

For catgraph-applied, this implies a non-obvious design insight: **the `wiring_diagram` + operadic substitution layer, once lifted to `[0,1]`-enriched named cospans, can express compositional grammar directly.** Concretely:

- Ports on inner/outer circles carry probabilistic hom-annotations.
- Operadic substitution (`WiringDiagram::substitute`) composes annotations multiplicatively (the enrichment base `([0,1], ·)` is the composition monoid).
- The free `[0,1]`-enriched monoidal category on a signature of port types is what BTV21's syntax category `L` is, up to choice of generators.

No changes to catgraph-applied v0.1.0 code; the point is that the *same* operadic substitution machinery already in `wiring_diagram.rs` becomes a grammatical engine once weighted. This is the bridge between [FS18] §6.5 (operads and operad algebras, unenriched) and [BTV21] (`[0,1]`-enriched language categories).

### Time-step discretization as a functor

The Wolfram-physics modules in `catgraph-physics` (`multiway::evolution_graph`, `hypergraph::evolution_cospan`) already implement a specific instance of the "continuous → discrete" functorial pattern: multiway evolution (branching, generative) is discretized into cospan chains (sequential, observational). See [`catgraph-physics`](../../catgraph-physics/src/multiway/evolution_graph.rs) module-header rustdoc (added in Phase 5.1) for the CT framing.

The same `C → D` functor pattern appears in [Gor23] (Gorard's functorial irreducibility) and in the Mamba-style state-space-model discretization (exponential-trapezoidal, bilinear transform, zero-order hold). Three different domains, one compositional pattern. [BV25]'s magnitude is a candidate quantitative measure of how much information `D` carries about `C`.

### Phase 6 target: `catgraph-magnitude`

The planned `catgraph-magnitude` sibling crate will provide `Semiring`,
`WeightedCospan<Q>`, `LmCategory`, and a `magnitude()` functional as v0.1.0
targets, anchored to [BTV21] (arXiv:2106.07890) and [BV25] (arXiv:2501.06662).
The magnitude functional `Mag(tA)` with Tsallis parameter `t` gives a
quantitative diversity invariant; `t=1` recovers Shannon entropy, `t=2`
recovers collision probability, and `t → ∞` recovers cardinality.

No catgraph-applied code change is required for any of the above. The
enrichment layer stays in the Phase 6 sibling crate.
